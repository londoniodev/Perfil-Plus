## 2024-03-26 - [Tenant Isolation Gap in Branding Updates]
**Vulnerability:** IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) combined with RLS Bypass.
**Learning:** Updates to a tenant's BrandSettings were using the non-secure Prisma client (`this.prisma.brandSettings.upsert()`). Even though `tenantId` was supplied, it bypassed Row-Level Security, allowing a user from one tenant to modify another tenant's branding if they manipulated the ID.
**Prevention:** Always use the injected `this.prisma.secure` client for operations scoped to a tenant. Only use the standard or `raw` clients for explicit global operations (like resolving the tenant context initially or global CRON jobs).
